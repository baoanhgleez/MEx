      ====================================

      public void getQuaternion (float[] quaternion, int offset)

      Provides the quaternion representing the head rotation.

      Parameters

      quaternion	Array where the quaternion (x, y, z, w) will be written to.
      offset	Offset in the array where data should be written.
      
      ====================================
      
      public void getForwardVector (float[] forward, int offset)

      Provides the direction the head is looking towards as a 3x1 unit vector.

      Note that in OpenGL the forward vector points into the -Z direction. Make sure to invert it if ever used to compute the basis of a         right-handed system.

      Parameters

      forward	Array where the forward vector will be written to.
      offset	Offset in the array where data should be written.
